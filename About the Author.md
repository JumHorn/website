I like programming very much. I feel it is a pleasure to complete a task every time I finish programming. Although I have learned many programming languages myself, I like C/C++ most. These  programming languages make me passionate in programming. At the same time, I am a fanatical Linux enthusiast, very fond of Linux philosophy, like command line and VIM. Based on Linux system, I have built LAMP system myself(my own blog website is an example) and I have built <a href="https://about.gitlab.com/">gitlab</a> for code version control and studied <a href="https://www.docker.com/">docker</a>, though now I only remember that whale head appeared the funny word Hello world.However it's really worth it. I like to do the <a href="https://leetcode.com/">leetcode</a> problems when I'm dull and go around the /r/ProgrammerHumor/ on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ProgrammerHumor/">reddit</a>.
